# PMC Routes Map

A learning project for myself.  I volunteer for the Pan Mass Challenge as crew lead for the volunteer photographers.  For me it is important to know all the routes, waterstops and hub locations so i can properly staff the volunteer photographers on PMC weekend.  This is a fun learning project to get better aquainted with data exploration and mapping within R.


A few examples of the maps produced by this R code

Babson to Babson (one day) Sunday route

Sturbridge to P-Town and Sturbridge to Babson (two day) Saturday and Sunday routes.

## Getting Started

If you want to clone the repo and play with R scripts, everything should be self explanatory.  The data is in the data/ folder and the packages used are fairly common.


### Prerequisites

In my code, for debugging, i do save data to .csv (from time to time) into the excluded/ folder.  
```
write.csv(waterstops,"excluded\\...
```

You may want to comment out that code.  You wont find the excluded/ folder in github, its removed via the .gitignore
