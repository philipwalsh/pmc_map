# PMC Routes Map

A learning project for myself.  I volunterr for the Pan Mass Challenge as volunteer photography crew lead.  For me it is important to know all the routes, waterstops and hub locations so i can properly staff the volunteer photographers on PMC weekend.  This is a fun learning project to get better aquainted with data exploration and mapping within R.

## Getting Started

If you want to clone the repo and play with R scripts, everything should be self explanatory.  The data is in the data/ folder and the packacges used are fairly common.


### Prerequisites

in my code, for debugging i do save data to csv into the excluded/ folder.  You may want to comment out that code.  You wont find that foder in github, its removed via the .gitignore
